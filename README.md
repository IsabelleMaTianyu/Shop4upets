# Shop for your pets
A group project for a dynamic web design course.
Based on the F3 framework
I was responsible for the creativity of the website, graphic design, front-end,
and back-end parts of the product detail pages and the search function.
The rest is the responsibility of my teammates to fill in the blanks.

Please watch the video to see how the website was built and how it functions.
